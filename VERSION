# You can leave this set to "0.0.0" in the repository.
#
# Note: Whenever someone publishes a GitHub Release of this repository,
#       the GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes a new
#       container image will update this file in the container image
#       so it contains the Git tag name associated with the Release
#       (it will typically omit the leading "v" character).

0.0.0
